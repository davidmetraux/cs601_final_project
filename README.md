# Current Work:
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
- Uses React
- Styled Banner with Image
- Navigational Menu
- React Router (Hash Router) for multiple pages
- Default React Page
- Test Page
- Page that uses Grid and Float that shows off a hobby of mine, Pathfinder

# Planned Work:
- Some sort of form, but am unsure how to do so because I don't plan on using an email server. Might just use it to calculate something. Maybe check if various social medias already has an account with a certain username?
- Some sort of actual resume: Might just recreate my actual resume with the grid layout.
- Some sort of contact page: Include social links. Maybe fetch recent linkedin posts or similar.
- Maybe some page that creates some sort of game... like where bubbles will drift up the screen and you have to click them
- Maybe some sort of starting-draw tester for Arkham Horror the Card Game, which I think I can get api for?

# Things I want feedback on:
- How much more should be added to the Pathfinder page to be satisfied
- If you think Planned Work are good ideas
- If you like the styling of the banner

# Cool Notable Things:
General:
- Flex used very often
- website works without CSS
- Works on mobile views down to ~350px
- TypeScript used

Banner:
- Gradient used
- Gradient used over headshot to give effect of fading out
- Title+Logo animates upwards when hovered over
- Buttons in nav animate to different color
Nav buttons are created by iterating through list

Main-area wrapper:
Scrollbar styled
